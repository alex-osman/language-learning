As she gracefully balances in a handstand, trying to inspire Uncle Jeff, a swan waddles in, somehow embodying more grace than Jeff could ever hope to muster.\n\nAria, never missing a beat, transitions into a therapeutic speech about acceptance and reaching out for help when needed, directly addressing the swan as if it's a part of the class. Uncle Jeff, now sitting on the floor looking defeated, extends his arms towards the swan in a gesture that screams \"I beg for the grace and balance you possess,\" creating a perfect tableau of the word \"乞\" - to beg, with Aria's teachings echoing as a backdrop."
