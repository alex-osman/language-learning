However, every time he tries to slide gracefully, he ends up stepping on a misplaced bobblehead of Jesus, causing him to trip and softly scold the bobbleheads with a \"Hee-hee\" and a playful wag of his finger, saying, \"You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal.\"\n\nThis unexpected scene is watched from the large, nicer bathroom window by the dogs, who seem to be judging Michael's moonwalking skills, leading Michael to playfully '骂' (mà), or scold, them in a light, humorous tone for their silent judgment. \n\nHere, in the Tone 4 location of Jean's backyard, Michael's playful scolding amidst the religious and quirky decor, under the watchful eyes of bobbleheads and dogs, creates a memorable tableau that vividly encapsulates the meaning of '骂' (mà) - to scold or berate, all while keeping a light and humorous air."
