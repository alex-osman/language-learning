“Alright, language lovers! It’s time for our ‘Next Character’ segment, where we flex our mental muscles and dive into the world of Mandarin! Today, we’re unpacking the character 力, which means ‘strength’ or ‘power.’ That’s right, 力—lì, as in ‘lì’ with the third tone! So spell it out with me: L-I, and let’s not forget that tone number 4!

Now, let’s use it in a simple sentence: 我有力! (Wǒ yǒu lì!) That means ‘I have strength!’ 

Now, back to 力... this character pops up more than you think! You might see it in things like 力量 (lìliàng), which means ‘power’ or ‘force,’ and even in the word for ‘powerful’—强力 (qiánglì). So, while it literally means strength, it’s often used in contexts that resonate with vigor and energy. 

So, whether you’re lifting weights or just trying to power through Monday morning, remember our star of the show today: 力! Stick around, because coming up next, we’ll arm you with even more vocabulary to build your Chinese language muscles! Don’t go anywhere!"
